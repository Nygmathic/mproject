## Whistleblower Submissions

At this time, we are **not accepting whistleblower tips or sensitive disclosures**.

We believe that requesting or receiving sensitive information without a **proven, trace‑free, and secure system** would be irresponsible and could put contributors at risk. Until we establish a method that allows people to share information **anonymously, securely, and without leaving a digital trail**, we have chosen to pause all whistleblower-related submissions.

This decision is made out of respect for the safety and privacy of potential sources.

When a secure and verifiable system is in place, we will clearly announce it here with detailed instructions and safeguards. Until then, please **do not send confidential, private, or sensitive information** through our contact forms, email, or social media channels.
