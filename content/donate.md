# Support Our Site
### Keep independent voices alive

This site is free to read and exists to share honest, thoughtful work. Some of our stories come from, voices—whistleblowers, experts, or ordinary people with experiences and truths worth sharing.

Contributions from readers help cover the costs of running the site and make it possible to focus on meaningful stories, not ads or clicks.

Supporting is optional. If you value independent, open publishing and want to help us keep it going, even a small contribution makes a difference.
