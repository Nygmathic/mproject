      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;AI.png&#34; alt=&#34;Artificial Intelligence drawbacks&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly become part of everyday life. From recommendation systems and chatbots to medical diagnostics and autonomous vehicles, AI promises efficiency, speed, and innovation. However, despite its impressive capabilities, AI also comes with significant drawbacks that deserve careful attention. Ignoring these issues can lead to long-term social, economic, and ethical consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One major drawback of AI is &lt;strong&gt;job displacement&lt;/strong&gt;. As AI systems automate tasks once performed by humans, many traditional jobs are at risk. Roles in manufacturing, customer support, transportation, and even creative industries are increasingly being replaced or augmented by machines. While new jobs may emerge, the transition is often uneven, leaving many workers without the skills or resources needed to adapt. This can widen economic inequality and create social instability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
